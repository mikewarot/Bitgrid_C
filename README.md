The BitGrid is a cartesian array of cells that interact with their neighbors to do computing without a Von Neumann architecture. Each cell is clocked in one of two phases, to eliminate race conditions, and make programming tractable.

This is using the coloring algorithm to eliminate race conditions that would otherwise arise.

I hope to have chips that run this code in the future.

As of August 22, 2024 - I've started using GitHub's CoPilot to build an emulator that you can use in your browser directly from the GitHub pages for this project. (See the link over on the right)
